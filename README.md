# Mission-Impossible
The mission of this repository is to learn the alogithms and gain perfection in them. It contains the algorithms in different programing languages in different possible methods. This mission also includes the study of data structures also.

This mission requires installing of the Java Jdk Kit in case you want to do it in your PC for Java and Python 2.7 for Python
There is another option too for those who have the access to the internet in their house. They can use ideone.com which is an online compliler and containes all kinds of programming languages.

Python set up file can be downloaded from their website and can be installed directly.

The installation of Java is a little hectic work and I would be getting back to it after a while. For now download the JDK kit from the oracle website. You can also follow the instuctions in the internet as we have a lot of resources avalable there on the internet.
